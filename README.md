Fluid Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website designed to be fluid with a mobile screen stopgate. Using a media query I have created a mobile stopgate that takes advantage of the unique UI/UX changes that occur between platforms. The website can be viewed and navigated comfortably on numerous screen sizes.

The mobile version has a nav that is moved to the bottom for easy thumb access and relies on the device's OS to render the menu instead of using drop-menus. This was accomplished using the ReSmenu.

I used Flexslider as the main carousel and Light Gallery for overlays. Major HTML and CSS edits to fit my site and a fluid format. Minor JavaScript edits to accompany.

I use MeyerWeb as my CSS Reset and build my own templates and sites from scratch. I'm familiar with using boilerplates and bootstrap, however I chose not to use them for this site. I wanted to drasticlly limit the amount of superfluous, unused code. Since this site is so simplistic I decided to build from scratch rather than strip back a standard boilerplate or template.
